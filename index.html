         <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local.
            Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
            The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976,
            education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states.
            The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’. 
            From this point on the central and state governments shared formal responsibility for funding and administration of education</p>

         <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for males and 65% for females. 
             National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for male and 70.3% for female.
             This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.
             India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.
              Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions.In January 2019, India had over 900 universities and 40,000 colleges.

         <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, 
             in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of operation.
              Hence, the differentiation of government schools and private schools can be misleading.
              However, in a report by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon entitled: The emptying of public Schools and growth of private schools in India, 
              it is said that For sensible education policy making, it is vital to take account of the changing trends in the size of the private and public schooling sectors in India. 
              Ignoring these trends involves the risk of poor policies/legislation, with attendant adverse consequences for children’s life chances.
